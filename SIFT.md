How does SIFT work?

The Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm detects points of interest of the image, named keypoints, by using convolution at different scales and then taking the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) of the resulting Gaussian-blurred images. Then, it goes through keypoint localization in order to reduce the number of unstable and unnecessary keypoints. Thereafter, a unique descriptor vector is computed for each keypoint. 

What are the results on a sample fingerprint (Dataset B, DB1, participant 101)?

(How) does SIFT match different impressions of the sample?
