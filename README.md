# Fingerprint_Recognition_Metrics

In this personal project, I compared the performance of two common image comparison tools: SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) and Neural networks, when applied to fingerprint recognition.

The dataset used is from the publicly available FVC2000 competition(http://bias.csr.unibo.it/fvc2000/).
The analysis is inspired by: Handbook of Fingerprint Recognition, Maltoni et al.
